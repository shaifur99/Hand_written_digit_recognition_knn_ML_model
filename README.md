ðŸš€ Project Update â€“ Handwritten Digit Recognition using KNN

I recently completed a project on Handwritten Digit Recognition using the MNIST dataset. The task of recognizing handwritten digits is challenging because each digit can be written in many different styles.

ðŸ”¹ By applying the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, my model achieved an accuracy of 97.05% on the test set.
ðŸ”¹ To validate the model further, I tested it with my own handwritten digits â€” captured through my phone. I wrote digits on paper, took photos, and fed them into the model. The exciting part? âœ… The model predicted them correctly!

Key Learnings:

Data preprocessing and reshaping image matrices for ML models

Implementing KNN for image classification

Evaluating and validating models using both standard datasets and self-generated test samples

This project enhanced my practical understanding of Machine Learning and gave me confidence in applying algorithms to real-world scenarios. Looking forward to diving deeper into CNNs and Deep Learning for even more complex recognition tasks.
